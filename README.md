## Description 

I built this project to showcase my ability to solve JS problems i encounter with the use of the web and what i've learnt in class. I created a Javascript file to creat a random password based on criteria answered by the user regarding characters used and length. I checked for full functionality after completing each requesite provided to me and debugged as necessary whilst adding comments to facilitate readability and clarification of how my code works. I condensed my code by assigning functions and called as and when necessary.
